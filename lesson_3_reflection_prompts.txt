When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
 
  
Yes, i would use a remote repository rather than keeping it in my computer.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?


because it would be too big and too difficult to manage.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   
Forks make a copy of another repository con GitHub without clone localy and push again.
Clones make a copy from a Github or other cloud repository to your pc.
Branches make a copy from another repo con your computer.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?


    
Its benefit comes by the opportunity to have a reference that github can track off and compare to its
copy.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

I would collaborate by interchanging manualy the project, in a very impractical way.
It's easier just to use Github or any other cloud workplace with others.
It would be very hard to work with manualy with others and unproductive.
